## Introduction

I have been programming Java some 20 years, so I didn't do this exercise to learn Java. I mainly wanted to implement the Simple Server using Java just to compare the Java implementation with previous Clojure and Javascript implementations and document my experiences between these three languages. Maybe later I will implement the Simple Server also using Python and Go. Another reason was to study the new Java 10 features. I would have used Java 11 but for some reason couldn't make it work in Gradle - maybe trying to fix that later and upgrade to Java 11.


## Gradle

You can create the gradle wrapper using command:

```bash
gradle wrapper
```
